</p>
<p>	Alberta’s chief medical officer of health Thursday said she feels personally betrayed after CBC News reported the contents of secret recordings that revealed disagreements and, at times, political interference in the province’s pandemic response.
</p>
<p>	“I am profoundly disappointed that confidential internal conversations have been shared, actions that are a violation of the public service oath and code of conduct,” Dr. Deena Hinshaw told a news conference.
</p>
<p>	“This is a personal betrayal and a betrayal of the trust that our hardworking team has placed in each other,” she said. There will be an internal investigation to try to determine who leaked the recordings, Hinshaw said.
</p>
<p>	CBC News also quoted several confidential sources, one of whom said Hinshaw had confided that her dealings with the politicians were an “uphill battle.”
</p>
<p>	“My dad used to say that if you and your partner always agree, then one of you is unnecessary,” she said, acknowledging that “at times I have felt frustrated as I am a human being. The reality is that it is critical to have multiple perspectives and that those perspectives are heard.”
</p>
<p>	But Hinshaw insisted, as she had previously, that she has always been treated respectfully by politicians and her advice has been considered in final decisions by the government. She again stressed her job is simply to provide advice.
</p>
<p>	“I was not elected by Albertans,” she said. “The final decisions are up to elected officials who were chosen by Alberta. This is how democracy works.
</p>
<p>	“I know that there are many views about how we should proceed. However, we are becoming divided when we most need to engage in respectful dialogue.”
</p>
<p>	A previous statement emailed to CBC News from a spokesperson for Premier Jason Kenney said it is the job of elected officials to make decisions and there was no political interference.
