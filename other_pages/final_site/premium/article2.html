    <h1>Soccer: Ottawa Atletico coach Mista plans to start
signing players for 2021 season in next few weeks
</h1>

<p>	Amid all the uncertainties about where and when Atletico Ottawa could start the 2021 season, coach Mista says one thing is clear when putting together the roster.
</p>
<p>	“We don’t want robots,” Mista said in a telephone interview from his home in Madrid Thursday, after officially agreeing to come back for a second season with the Canadian Premier League soccer franchise.
</p>
<p>	“We want players who think. We want to try and sign players who accommodate our style of play, players who play inside. We want to have more control of the ball.”
</p>
<p>	It’s difficult to read too much into what Mista describes as Atletico’s “incomplete” first season.
</p>
<p>	After being idle most of the summer due to COVID-19 restrictions, Atletico finished the CPL’s Island Games bubble tournament in Charlottetown, P.E.I., with a record of two wins, three losses and two draws, narrowly missing advancing to a second round.
</p>
<p>	As limited as the schedule was, Mista says he learned plenty about his own team and the rest of the CPL, an experience which should be an advantage in 2021.
</p>
<p>	“I’m very happy to come back,” said Mista. “The 1 ½ months (in P.E.I.) were very important. We came a long way inside the field. With maybe more time, we could have become a better team.
</p>
<p>	“For us, everything was new. If there was a normal pre-season, you have time (to develop), you would know how players respond to pressure. We didn’t have that.”
</p>
<p>	The plan is for Atletico to start signing players for the 2021 season within the next two to three weeks, but everything is subject to COVID-19 developments.
</p>
<p>	Three weeks ago, Atletico strategic partner Jeff Hunt told Postmedia the franchise is optimistic that games will be played in front of fans at TD Place in the spring.
</p>
<p>	Whether than comes to pass depends on how well the city, province and country have contained the virus, along with the health and safety restrictions that will be in place.
</p>
<p>	Last year, Atletico’s plans for a grand debut took a wild twist when COVID-19 became real. In March, the club was only days into its training camp in Madrid — home of Atletico’s parent squad — when players and staff hurried to get to Canada before borders were shut down.
</p>
<p>	The players worked around the recreational restrictions in Ottawa for five months before finally playing in Charlottetown.
</p>
<p>	The plan for 2021 is to once again kick off the season with a training camp in Madrid.
</p>
<p>	“We hope,” said Mista. “There’s a high restriction of mobility here, but there are fewer cases here than a month ago.”
