    <p>  Hello! My name's Julia Spinney. I am born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario. I have three dogs and a cat. I turned 18 a couple weeks ago. </p>
    <p> I have not done much so far so I don't have very much to write here. I like drawing, reading, and video games (I know, riveting). I collect fountain pens and I like to send postcards.</p>

        <h2>My First Game</h2>
        <p>Here is my first game! I made it in the two weeks in between Portfolio Day and when I submitted my application for Concordia. I have not updated it since.</p>
