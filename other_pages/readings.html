    <h2>As We May Think Reflection</h2>
    <h3>Week of 24/09/20</h3>

    <p> Vannevar Bush’s article, As We May Think, from 1945, is an incredibly interesting snapshot of predictions for the future. He outlines a problem that man has encountered in the development of modern science; There is just too much information
      to be consumed. They had so many papers and articles, and it would be impossible to catalogue and read them all. As Bush mentioned, this can result in cases like Mendel’s concept of the laws of genetics, a situation where his publication was,
      “lost to the world for a generation.” Bush spends the rest of the article speculating on how we could solve this problem.</p>
    <p> Bush makes an incredibly accurate prediction of a computer in this article. There are some hang-ups, like his inability to see past film in cameras, or how he imagines a typewriter’s keyboard to work in tandem with a set of buttons and
      levers, but what he does do, is predict a computer that must be told by its user what to do. While some other future predictions might have a computer do everything by itself, Bush imagines a computer to be a tool for its user to use. There are
      also many comical, accidental predictions. When he mentions the camera being attached to a man’s glasses, I was reminded of those silly snapchat sunglasses that nobody bought because they were so useless. </p>
    <p>Reading the article was also a bit depressing. Whenever I read past articles or speculative fiction of what the future has in store, as something exciting and helpful, it’s sad to compare it with our future predictions today. When most people
      think of the future today, we think of a world ravaged by climate change, or capitalism, or nuclear annihilation, or any number of other things. If Bush was writing 2020’s As We May Think, the predictions would be a lot less positive, and a lot
      more about how technology might be our ruin.</p>
    <p>In addition to this, Bush’s careful explanation of the different elements that make up his dry photography, microphotography, or “memex,” make me realize I have no idea how our modern technology even works. When he described a solution to the
      “prosaic problem of the department store,” I thought about my own cashier job, how I have no idea how our system works. For all I know our existing totals could be read by photocell, the new total entered by an electron beam. And our current
      cash computer and system are from the 90s, so I cannot begin to imagine how the iPad cashes at the Apple Store work.</p>
    <p>Overall, it was an interesting article to read. It was cool to see how people thought the future would be like in 1945, but hard to read without thinking that they would probably be disappointed if they knew what it was really like. It makes
      me wonder how many scientists were inspired by this article, if Bush had any effect on our modern computers by speaking them into possibility.</p>

    <h2>The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would mess it up reflection</h2>
    <h3>Week of 10/01/20</h3>
    <p>Daniel Joseph’s article, The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up, is an interesting look into early internet development. I think many of Canadians’ suspicions about a States-dominated web proved
      true, like the dangers of unchecked capitalism, and some privacy issues. However, I also think we have preserved some elements of the original 1970s liberalism sentiments.</p>
    <p>I find it frustrating how much the US dominates the internet. Maybe it’s just on the English-speaking side, or maybe just in the social spheres I frequent, but everything seems so US centric. While it’s true that the United States are huge
      players on the world stage, it can feel pretty excessive sometimes. I remember one year it was the month of our federal elections, with the US’ a year away, and everything I saw was focused on the States. A year away! And ours was in a couple
      weeks. It has always frustrated me, but I don’t know what a real solution would be. Canadian Twitter?</p>
    <p>I think some of the fears about the effects of unchecked American capitalism that Canadians held, and hold, are very real. The internet is rife with excessive and invasive ads and cookies, and the fact that most popular websites, like products
      in a supermarket, are run by the same couple companies, is also a disappointing reality. While there are some classic forums still in operation, most conversations have migrated to larger websites, like on subreddits or Facebook groups. The
      States’ capitalistic influence on the internet has also brought about many worries with privacy. </p>
    <p>These privacy concerns mentioned in the article also are an issue today. Not only is it guaranteed that there are organizations, both governmental and not, monitoring your internet usage, many people invite it further into their homes with
      smart devices. I saw a news story a while back about someone hacking a baby monitor and talking to the child through it. That is so terrifying to me. I’m not a conspiracy theorist by any means, but if I think about these privacy issues too
      long, I will burn my computer and move into the bush. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, I think there is still some lingering sentiments of the original internet, especially in the realm of computer science. There are too many coding tutorial websites to count, and also many forums about it. Basically, if
      someone has the time and a computer, they can learn to code. I think that’s really incredible. There are not many other fields that are as accessible as that. I think part of the reason I was, and am, drawn to computer science is because of
      that desire to educate and share. </p>

    <h2>web_work_reflection</h2>
    <h3>Week of 10/08/20</h3>
    <p>Rachel Greene’s article, Web Work: A HISTORY OF INTERNET ART is a short catalogue of the developing net.art scene. It was published in 2000, making many of the sites she credits replaced or disconnected. It is an interesting look at the early
      days of internet art, and internet culture.</p>
    <p>Sadly, many of the urls Greene mentions in her article are no longer in use. I felt like an archeologist trying to find the sites mentioned. Uncovering the bones of these once-frequented spaces. Vuk Cosic’s 7-11.org, for example, is now what
      appears to be a Thai movie review site. The Thing is partially catalogued on anthology.rhizome.org/the-thing, but is also no longer in operation. One of the sites that is still in operation, though, is jodi.org, which is cool to see.
      wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/100cc/index.html is still accessible, although many of its links are unfortunately broken now. </p>
    <p>Looking at these websites its clear how much online art has evolved. Although, many things have stayed the same. 7-11.org was an imitation of the convenience store chain’s site, because it was intended as a ‘convenient’ way for artists to
      share information. Website parodies, in a similar way, are still very prevalent today. In class, we talked about an NRA parody website, that mocks that same corporate site feeling. It’s interesting to see the changes and similarities in
      internet culture. </p>
    <p> Perhaps one of the reasons these sites feel so ancient to me is because they were all running before I was born. Even this article was published before then. By the time I was online, the age of the corporation-clogged net was already in full
      swing. My first online friends were made on Instagram, not chatrooms. I don’t have a nostalgia or a connection to the pre-2010s internet at all, and I was up and interneting pretty young. It makes this article feel less like a report and more
      like a page in a textbook.</p>
